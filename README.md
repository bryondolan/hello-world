#About Me
# I've been involved with application developement/project management/MIS since 1978. I've watched the evolution of this industry grow from a promising technology that could be used for ALL, to actually surpassing this notion and becoming a technology that is absolutley NECESSARY in order for modern day humans to achieve thier hopes and dreams. I'm just as passionate about this industry now (if not more so) than the first time I went to Radio Shack back in 1978 at age 18, bought a TRS-80 and learned to code BASIC over a weekend, and then returned the machine on the following Monday to get a refund as I had exhausted the machines capabilities (4K Ram, cassette recorder for saving data, and no connectivity). However, I was hooked from this day forward! I enlisted in the NAVY (no career plan prior to this) under their Advanced Electronics program and after boot camp >> submarine training, was fast tracked into learning over the next two years (eight hour classoom days) of Basic Electronics (DC/AC Circuit Theory), Advanced Electronics (Transistors, Capacitors, Diodes, Amplifiers), Digital Electronics (and-or-nand-nor-counter transistor logic), and finally Advanced Computer Design/Operation/Troubleshooting (Ram, Rom, Memory, Pill (clock), I/O, A/D converters, D/A converters, MTU, and binary machine langauge coding). After completing my Navy education with honors, my military classification was as a 'Central Navigation Computer Technician' on-board Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) Submarines for the next four years while holding a TOP-SECRET clearance.
